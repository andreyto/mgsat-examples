Analysis of Dieting study 16S data

##### \(1.4.1.1.4\) Plots of Abundance difference between paired samples. Samples are paired according to attribute SubjectID, resulting in 14 pairs. When fold change or difference is computed, this is done as 'before.diet by after.diet'.



Plots are shown with relation to various combinations of meta 
                   data variables and in different graphical representations. Lots of plots here.



##### \(1.4.1.1.4.2\) Iterating over all combinations of grouping variables




##### \(1.4.1.1.4.2.1\) Entire pool of samples




##### \(1.4.1.1.4.2.2\) Iterating over Abundance difference between paired samples. Samples are paired according to attribute SubjectID, resulting in 14 pairs. When fold change or difference is computed, this is done as 'before.diet by after.diet'. profile sorting order




##### \(1.4.1.1.4.2.2.1\) Abundance difference between paired samples. Samples are paired according to attribute SubjectID, resulting in 14 pairs. When fold change or difference is computed, this is done as 'before.diet by after.diet'. profile sorting order: GeneSelector paired test ranking




##### \(1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2\) Iterating over dodged vs faceted bars



The same data are shown in multiple combinations of graphical representations. 
                         This is the same data, but each plot highlights slightly different aspects of it.
                         It is not likely that you will need every plot - pick only what you need.



##### \(1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.1\) faceted plots. Iterating over orientation and, optionally, scaling




##### \(1.4.1.1.4.2.2.2.1.1\) Abundance difference between paired samples. Samples are paired according to attribute SubjectID, resulting in 14 pairs. When fold change or difference is computed, this is done as 'before.diet by after.diet'. Plot is in original orientation, Y axis SQRT scaled. Iterating over plot geometry
