##### \(1.6.1.1.7\) Network Analysis Feature correlation with overlaid differential abundance results 



Build network of interactions between features or samples and plot it. 
                           Network method is network.spiec.easi. Method parameters are: [ list()].


Filtering abundance matrix with arguments [ drop.names:"other" "Unclassified_Bacteria"]. Network Analysis


After filtering, left 67 records for 5 features
